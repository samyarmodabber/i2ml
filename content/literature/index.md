## Additional References for the Course Topics

The course material covers all exam-relevant topics. For more in-depth study of the courses and additional machine learning topics, we recommend the following literature (note that some of the books are quite detailed and involved, and more geared towards a larger lecture in a Master's degree):

*Good intro to information theory in first hundred pages, though lacking cross-connections to ML / statistics.*


## R Programming

We use the *mlr3* package for machine learning in R.
