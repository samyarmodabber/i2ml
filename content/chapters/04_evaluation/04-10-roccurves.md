In this section, we explain the ROC curve and how to calculate it. In addition, we will present the AUC as a global performance measure that integrates over all possible thresholds.

**ROC**

You can run the code snippets in the demos on your local machine. The corresponding Rmd version of this demo can be found [here](https://github.com/compstat-lmu/lecture_i2ml/blob/master/code-demos/code_demo_roc.Rmd). If you want to render the Rmd files to PDF, you need the accompanying [style files](https://github.com/compstat-lmu/lecture_i2ml/tree/master/style).

## Which statements are true? 

- [x] Logistic regression minimizes the binomial loss.
- [x] The Brier score is like the MSE, just with probabilities.
- [ ] The log-loss punishes being very wrong less than the Brier score.
- [ ] Accuracy and mean classification error are calculated using the predicted probabilities.
- [x] The confusion matrix tabulates the true against predicted classes.
- [ ] A misclassification error rate of 0.1% is always great.

## Which statements are true? 

- [ ] If the proportion of positive to negative instances in the training data changes, the ROC curve will not change.
- [x] If the proportion of positive to negative instances in the test data changes, the ROC curve will not change.
- [x] Several evaluation metrics can be derived from a confusion matrix.
- [x] The area under the ROC curve is called AUC.
- [ ] A model with AUC=0 is the worst case.

## Which statements are true? 

- [ ] Using the prediction on the train data is the ordinary and correct way of calculating the ROC.
- [x] The calculation of the ROC should be done on a test set.
- [x] The AUC is not affected by the threshold, as opposed to the MCE.
